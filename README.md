### 🧐 About me

Hello! I'm Julien! 

I aim to enhance human relationships making cooperation emerge instead of conflicts. To better understand this collective intelligence, or more globally intelligence, I dived into artificial intelligence, deep learning, reinforcement learning, psycho sociology and philosophy. And the more I learn, the more I am fascinated 😄!

I am currently a second-year student at CentraleSupélec where I learn step by step on these fields, mainly thanks to lectures, books, Moocs, competitions, and fruitful discussions !
